# exsaasperated-comments

This repository exists solely to host comment threads for our blog over at https://exsaasperated.com.  Each post will have an issue related to it, where you can add comments that will show up on the blog, under the post.  Unfortunately you'll need a Github login to be able to participate in the discussion.

Special thanks to https://dc25.github.io/myBlog/2017/06/24/using-github-comments-in-a-jekyll-blog.html, whose approach I've used and adapted here.
